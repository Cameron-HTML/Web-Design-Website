					Many people don't count FRC as a sport, but many if not all of the competitors do, as stated in the video "Our name is,
					"For inspiration and recognition of science and technology."
					But it's also FIRST because I've never seen kids running around
					at a sporting event of any sport,
					cheering, "I want to be second."
					So I said, "We'll create a sport...
					Which-- The only difference between our sport and the others
					is in our sport, every kid can turn pro. Every kid." You can find the full interview to the right.
